## Overview

Welcome to the Blockchain and Decentralized Applications (DApps) repository! This project provides an implementation of a blockchain and demonstrates how to build DApps on top of it. The goal is to educate developers on the principles of blockchain technology and the development of DApps.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions in a secure and immutable way. Here is a visual representation of a blockchain:

### Key Concepts

- **Blocks**: Each block contains a list of transactions.
- **Hashing**: Each block is linked to the previous block via a unique hash.
- **Decentralization**: Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network.
- **Immutability**: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered.

## What are DApps?

Decentralized Applications (DApps) are applications that run on a blockchain network rather than a centralized server. Here is an illustration of how DApps work:

### Characteristics of DApps

- **Open Source**: The source code is open and available to all.
- **Decentralized**: Operates on a blockchain network.
- **Incentivized**: Users are rewarded with tokens for participation.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Uses mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) for validation.

## Features

- **Blockchain Core**: Basic blockchain implementation with block creation, hashing, and validation.
- **DApp Example**: Sample DApp demonstrating interaction with the blockchain.
- **API Integration**: REST API to interact with the blockchain.

## Installation
